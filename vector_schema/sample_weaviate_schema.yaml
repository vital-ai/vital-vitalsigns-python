# schema file for vector vitalservice
# this is used to override using the ontology directly for the schema
# which can be used in place of/or until the ontology has vector annotations
# the vitalservice config file specifies the embedding models for classes (collections)
# so either the ontology or schema must define collections/classes and the
# vitalservice config info augments this
